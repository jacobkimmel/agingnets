# SETTINGS FILE --- Magnum v1.0
#
# This file can be used to:
# (1) Run the job from the command line (typically on a computing cluster)
# (2) Reload the settings in the App (click the "Settings" button)
#
# TIP: Keeping this file together with your results ensures that they can
#      always be reproduced!
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# To run the job from the command line, download the command-line tool
# (magnum_v1.0.jar) from regulatorycircuits.org and use the option --set
# to load this file (see user guide for details):
#
#    java -Xmx6g -jar magnum_v1.0.jar --set <settings_file>
#
# NOTE: If your run the job on a cluster, you have to edit the file paths
#       below so that they point to the right location.
